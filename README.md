Inspired by the MIT YouTube lectures. Tested on GNU CLISP.

LISP has a special place in my heart.
Paul Graham's essays have inspired me
to learn functional programming using LISP.

Most of the code in this repository
has been taken from the MIT Lectures:
"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs."

Special thanks to Prof. Harold Abelson,
Prof. Gerald Jay Sussman,
Prof. Julie Sussman,
And to MIT for making these videos public.

"Now I eat parentheses for breakfast;
And if my program isn't done
I eat parentheses for lunch!"
